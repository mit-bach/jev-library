# TypeSafe Python SDK

Install the TypeSafe Python SDK and get started with asynchronous or synchronous API calls.

Asynchronous and synchronous Python clients for the[TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai/)API. Learn how to use TypeSafe[here](https://docs.typesafe.ai/).

## Quickstart

1. Install the SDK:- uv
- pip

```
uv add typesafe-sdk
```

```
pip install typesafe-sdk
```
2. Set`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`in your environment (create it[here](https://console.typesafe.ai/))
3. Call the System One API:- Async
- Sync

With[AsyncTypeSafeClient](python/api/clients/async/client.md):```
from typesafe_sdk import AsyncTypeSafeClient, Choice, Noul, Score

async def main() -> None:
 async with AsyncTypeSafeClient() as client:
 response = await client.system_one(
 state={"document": "I was charged twice. Please fix this ASAP."},
 questions={
 "billing": Noul(instructions="Is this ticket about billing?"),
 "tone": Choice(
 instructions="What is the customer's tone?",
 criteria={"calm": None, "frustrated": None, "angry": None},
 ),
 "urgency": Score(
 instructions="How urgent is this ticket?",
 criteria=["can wait", "this week", "today"],
 ),
 },
 )

 print(response.nouls["billing"].noul)
 print(response.choices["tone"].choice)
 print(response.scores["urgency"].score)
```

With[TypeSafeClient](python/api/clients/sync/client.md):```
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, Score, TypeSafeClient

with TypeSafeClient() as client:
 response = client.system_one(
 state={"document": "I was charged twice. Please fix this ASAP."},
 questions={
 "billing": Noul(instructions="Is this ticket about billing?"),
 "tone": Choice(
 instructions="What is the customer's tone?",
 criteria={"calm": None, "frustrated": None, "angry": None},
 ),
 "urgency": Score(
 instructions="How urgent is this ticket?",
 criteria=["can wait", "this week", "today"],
 ),
 },
 )

print(response.nouls["billing"].noul)
print(response.choices["tone"].choice)
print(response.scores["urgency"].score)
```
